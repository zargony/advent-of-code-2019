# Advent of Code 2019

My solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019](http://adventofcode.com/2019) puzzles, written in [Rust](http://rust-lang.org).

This time, all solutions will feature [async-await](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2019/11/07/Async-await-stable.html) using the [async-std](https://async.rs/) runtime.

My main goal is not to create the quickest / shortest / fastest solution ever, but to create nice, idiomatic, readable and maintainable Rust code with suitable performance.
